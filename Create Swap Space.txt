1.Check available disk space: df -h
2.Create a 2G swap file:sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
3.Set appropriate permissions: Change the permissions of the swap file 
to only allow root to read and write to it: sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

4.Set up the swap space:To set up the swap space on the newly created 
file, use the mkswap command: sudo mkswap /swapfile

5.Enable the swap file: Activate the swap file using 
the swapon command: sudo swapon /swapfile


7.Make the swap space persistent:Open the /etc/fstab 
file in a text editor (e.g., using vi nano /etc/fstab) and add the 
following line at the end of the file: /swapfile none swap sw 0 0

Verify the swap space: Confirm that the swap file is now being used by running the free command:
#free -h
The output should show the swap space in use

To show swap Space command:
swapon --show
